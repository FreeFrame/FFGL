Eclipse Project setup for Windows with MinGW

Setup:
You will need to add an environment variable defining the install 
location of your FreeFrame SDK:
- Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Environment
  - Click the Add button
  - Set the name to FFGLSDKHome
  - Set the value to the root folder for your FreeFrame SDK (ex.
    C:\User\username\FFGLSDK )

This FFGLHost project was created and tested on Windows Vista using 
the MinGW ToolChain. You should be able to use it with Cygwin or other
tool chains but you may need to change the tool chain settings from
the project properties menu. You may also find that the FreeFrame SDK is
is not compatible with other compiler types. See the FreeFrame SourceForge
site for more details.
