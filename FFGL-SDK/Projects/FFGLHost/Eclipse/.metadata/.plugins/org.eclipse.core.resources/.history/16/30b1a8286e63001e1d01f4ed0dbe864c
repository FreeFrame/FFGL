Eclipse Project setup for Windows with MinGW

Setup:
Make sure you have your Toolchain for cdt setup. Some good information
can be found with a little googling. This was a good resource as well:
http://www.ritgamedev.com/tutorials/glutEclipse/. My environment uses 
the following:
- MinGW 5.1.4
- MSys 1.0.10
- GDB 6.3 (I had issues with the newer versions of GBD + CDT)
- GLUT MinGW

You will need to add an environment variable defining the install 
location of your FreeFrame SDK:
- Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Environment
  - Click the Add button
  - Set the name to FFGLSDKHome
  - Set the value to the root folder for your FreeFrame SDK (ex.
    C:\User\username\FFGLSDK )
    
When you want to run the project, there is an FFGLHost run/debug configuration.
However, you will need to edit the source code mapping to match the 
location of your code:
- Run > Run Configurations > C++/C Local Application > FFGLHost
  - Click on the Source tab
  - Click Path Mappings : Found Mappings
  - Click Edit
  - Click on the mapping in the list and click Edit to change it
  - Change the location to match the root of your FFGL SDK checkout
    (the same url as the environment variable you setup earlier). 

Notes:
I've added a builder that moves both the Debug and Release versions
of the output executable into the binaries folder of the FFGLSDK
on successful builds. If you receive Ant errors on builds, you can
disable the builder by:
- Project > Properties > Builders
  - Deselect the Move Debug Files and Move Release Files builders.

This FFGLHost project was created and tested on Windows Vista using 
the MinGW ToolChain. You should be able to use it with Cygwin or other
tool chains but you may need to change the tool chain settings from
the project properties menu. You may also find that the FreeFrame SDK is
is not compatible with other compiler types. See the FreeFrame SourceForge
site for more details.  

TODO:
Create Run configurations.

Run build that moves files as part of run configurations rather than
post build tasks?

Test MinGW source code changes.

Can I remove the common and include source code directories?

The build output contains both relative and absolute paths. Is it supposed
to be like this? Where do these paths come from?

Can I set the environment variable to a relative path from the workspace?

Create OSX and Linux project versions. They will probably need different
linker properties.
