FreeFrameGL SDK

Host and Plugin Binaries for OSX
compiled by Trey Harrison - www.harrisondigitalmedia.com
--------------------------------------------------------

To test the binaries on OSX, open a terminal window, navigate to the Binaries/OSX
folder, and run ./FFGLHost (for some reason, running FFGLHost from the finder does not work
because the finder doesnt start the application in its own directory)

Mouse movement is used to assign values to plugin #1 parameter #0 and plugin #2 parameter #0.
